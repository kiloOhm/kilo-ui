	<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</p>
	<p>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</p>
	<p>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</p>
	<p>And summer's lease hath all too short a date;</p>
	<p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</p>
	<p>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;</p>
	<p>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</p>
	<p>By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;</p>
	<p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</p>
	<p>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;</p>
	<p>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</p>
	<p>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:</p>
	<p>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</p>
	<p>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
